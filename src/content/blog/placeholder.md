Hey! This is a placeholder post while I set things up.

I'm planning to write about:
- ML/AI stuff (the good, the bad, and the overhyped)
- Software development experiences
- Things I learned the hard way
- Maybe some tutorials if I'm feeling ambitious

For now, feel free to check out my [experience page](/experience/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/grobenek).

Real content coming soon. Probably.
