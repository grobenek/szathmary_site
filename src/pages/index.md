**Welcome!** I’m Peter, an AI/ML engineer with some web development experience.  

This site doubles as my CV and a place where I’ll share ideas and tutorials about ML/AI and other topics that I am interested in.  

If you want to get in touch, you can contact me via [email](mailto:peter.szathmary@szathmary.sk).  

You can also send me encrypted messages using PGP:

- [Search on OpenPGP Key Server](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=peter.szathmary@szathmary.sk)  

And here’s a picture of my dog Benny:
