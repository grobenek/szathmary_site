## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on. Mix of academic work, open-source contributions, and personal learning experiments.

### Notable Projects

**Diploma Thesis: Sentiment Analysis & Opinion Detection**  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/grobenek/diploma_thesis)  
Built ML models using Keras for sentiment analysis and opinion detection. Explored deep learning for NLP tasks.

**Bachelor Thesis: Modbus-based Electrical Measurements Dashboard**  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/grobenek/bakalarska_praca_BE)  
IoT application for visualizing real-time electrical measurements from Modbus devices. Spring Boot backend handled data acquisition and storage in MySQL/InfluxDB, while Angular frontend with PrimeNG and ECharts provided live dashboards and time-series charts. Involved protocol handling, database design, and real-time data visualization.

**Custom Neural Network**  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/grobenek/custom-neural-network)  
Implemented a basic neural network from scratch in Java to understand ML fundamentals without relying on frameworks.

**docxjs - Document Rendering Library**  
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/VolodymyrBaydalka/docxjs)  
Contributor to this TypeScript library for rendering DOCX files (1.8k GitHub stars). Made contributions that were merged into the original repository, improving the library used by real-world projects.

**Data Structures & Algorithms Projects**  
- [Quad Tree Implementation](https://github.com/grobenek/Quad_tree) - Spatial partitioning data structure
- [Dynamic Hash File](https://github.com/grobenek/Dynamic_hash_file) - File-based hash table with dynamic resizing
